Note:
    For Problem 1, please run test_objects.py to see how the code runs.
    For Problem 2, please run edge_detection_driver.py.

p1: For the threshold value, I used 110 in test_objects.py.
    The function, of course, can take any value for the argument.

p2: Rather than assigning labels 0, 1, 2 to detected objects, I assigned
    larger values that make sense in grayscale. In other words, when the
    labeled image is written to a .pgm file, different objects have
    actually distinguishable grayscale colors.

p3: No additional attributes other than the ones required by the problem
    were added to the database output.

p4: Most of the attributes saved for each object were not that helpful
    in detecting the same object in different images. The one that actually
    helped was "roundness". Because roundness is E_min/E_max, it was the
    most distinguishing feature amongst different objects. However,
    I had to account for +- 10% of variability here as well.

p5: I used to 3*3 Sobel mask because it was the one that worked reasonably
    well on the input images.

p6: I used [-rho_max, rho_max] as the number of rows of the accumulator
    array and [-90, 90] as the number of columns for the accumulator array.
    The reason that I chose this was that the time it took to process the
    sample images was not that long even for these dimensions.

    As for the voting scheme, I did the common way of incrementing the
    position in the accumulator array if the thresholded image had a non-
    zero value at a particular pixel point.

    For the edge threshold, I used 100 because it worked well. (trial and
    error approach)

p7: For the threshold for images 'hough_simple_1.pgm' and 'hough_simple_2.pgm', 
    I used 230 after various trial and errors.
    For 'hough_complex_1.pgm', I used a threshold value of 85.

edge_detection_driver.py: There were some issues with importing the
                          individual functions from separate files, so 
                          I copied and pasted all the code in the separate
                          files into this one file.
