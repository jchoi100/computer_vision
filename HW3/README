Problem 1)
    Note:
        1) Please see p1.py for this problem.
            The code is implemented as a script.
            It can be run either by pasting in the code to a python 
            terminal or by simply typing "python p1.py" in the terminal.

        2) In implementing 1 nearest neighbor search, I used the 
            distance weighted approach. (This is how I kept note of the 
            "votes" before running the 1NN.) The values were normalized.

        3) This code assumes the following directory structure.
                current directory
                    |____ p1.py
                    |____ /train/
                    |        |____ faces
                    |        |____ trees
                    |           .
                    |           .
                    |        |____ buildings
                    |____ /test/
                             |____ faces
                             |____ trees
                                .
                                .
                             |____ buildings    
    Accuracy Results:
        I ran the code on different k values and different number
        of images used for training.
        Generally, if k is larger, results should be better.
        However, for my series of tests, the accuracy values were
        not consistent. Some results are reported below.

        Due to time constraints (for large k values and many 
        training images, tests ran for over 9 hours...), I used
        a subset of images in the training set to train and all
        the test images for testing.

        1) k = 800
            accuracy = 88/300 = 0.2933333
        2) k = 1600
            accuracy = 91/300 = 0.3033333
        3) k = 2500
            accuracy = 82/300 = 0.2733333

Problem 2)
    Note:
        1) Please see p2.py for this problem.
            The code is implemented as a script.
            It can be run either by pasting in the code to a python 
            terminal or by simply typing "python p2.py" in the terminal.

        2) This code assumes the following directory structure.
                current directory
                    |____ p2.py
                    |____ scene_l.bmp
                    |____ scene_r.bmp
